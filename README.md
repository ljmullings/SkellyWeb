Bubble is a full-stack web application project designed to facilitate learning and experimentation with modern web development technologies, including Next.js, PostgreSQL, React, and Git. AKA (I need something fun to do :D)
Im planning on practicing, sql/cloud storage, making RESTful APIs and a sandbox env with wayyy too many functionalities. This is all for the sake of refreshing/learning in depth. 

Up next: OPENAI API
